# A/B Test Analysis: Media Rail Layout Impact on a Cooking Website

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of changing the media rail layout from horizontal to vertical on a cooking website's product page. As a student, I conducted this A/B test to explore how layout changes affect user engagement and sales, measured through key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), page views, add-to-cart rates, clicks on media, and time spent on the page.

## Objectives
- To determine whether a vertical media rail layout influences user behavior and sales performance compared to a traditional horizontal layout.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of A/B testing as a method for website optimization and user experience enhancement.

## Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The change to a vertical media rail layout does not significantly affect the GMV.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The change to a vertical media rail layout significantly affects the GMV.

## Methodology
### A/B Testing Framework
- **Test Group A (Control):** Users experienced the original horizontal media rail layout.
- **Test Group B (Variant):** Users experienced the new vertical media rail layout.

### Metrics Evaluated
- **Primary Metric:** GMV.
- **Secondary Metrics:** Number of page views, number of add-to-cart actions, clicks on media, and time spent on the page.

### Statistical Analysis
- T-tests were applied to compare the means of each metric between the two variants.
- The analysis was supported by visual data exploration, including histograms and boxplots, to understand the distribution of metrics.

## Results
- **GMV:** No significant difference was found between the two layout variants, suggesting that the layout change does not significantly impact sales.
- **Secondary Metrics:** Significant differences were observed in page views, add-to-cart actions, and clicks on media, indicating increased user engagement with the vertical layout. Time on page was unaffected.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
- The primary metric (GMV) analysis suggests maintaining the current horizontal layout, as the vertical layout does not significantly enhance sales performance.
- The observed improvements in secondary metrics with the vertical layout highlight potential areas for future optimization and testing. Further investigation, possibly incorporating usability testing, could provide deeper insights into enhancing user experience and engagement.

## Future Work
- Explore additional modifications to the vertical layout to assess potential impacts on the primary metric.
- Conduct usability testing to gain qualitative insights into user preferences and behavior patterns.
